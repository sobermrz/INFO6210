    "### 1.3 Features\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a database for document storage, which is relatively simple and easy to operate.  \n",
    "You can set any attribute index (such as: FirstName = \"Sameer\", Address = \"8 Gandhi Road\") in MongoDB records to achieve faster sorting.  \n",
    "You can create data mirrors locally or on the network, which makes MongoDB more scalable.  \n",
    "If the load increases (requires more storage space and stronger processing power), it can be distributed on other nodes in the computer network. This is called sharding.  \n",
    "Mongo supports rich query expressions. The query command uses JSON format tags to easily query the embedded objects and arrays in the document.  \n",
    "MongoDb can use the update () command to replace the completed document (data) or some specified data fields.  \n",
    "Map / reduce in Mongodb is mainly used to batch process and aggregate data.  \n",
    "Map and Reduce. The Map function calls emit (key, value) to traverse all the records in the collection, and passes the key and value to the Reduce function for processing.  \n",
    "The Map function and Reduce function are written in Javascript, and MapReduce operations can be performed through the db.runCommand or mapreduce commands.  \n",
    "GridFS is a built-in feature in MongoDB that can be used to store a large number of small files.  \n",
    "MongoDB allows script execution on the server side. You can write a function in Javascript and execute it directly on the server side. You can also store the function definition on the server side and call it directly next time.  \n",
    "MongoDB supports various programming languages: RUBY, PYTHON, JAVA, C ++, PHP, C # and other languages.  \n",
    "MongoDB is easy to install.  "

When there are too many logs, even if the objectId alone is referenced, it will easily exceed the document limit size. So at this time, we use the following method:\n",

    "1) The order of magnitude represented by n is very small. And when the entity represented by n does not need to operate separately, it can adopt embedded modeling.\n",

    "3) When the magnitude of n is large, we have no choice. It is only possible to add a reference to terminal 1 at terminal n."

    "This type of database has these characteristics: non-relational, distributed, open source, and horizontally scalable. The original purpose was for large-scale web applications. Someone in the early stage of this brand-new database revolution proposed that the trend will grow even higher in 2009. NoSQL proponents advocate the use of non-relational data storage. Common applications such as: free mode, simple replication support, simple API, eventual consistency (non-ACID), and large-capacity data. NoSQL is the key-value storage that we use the most, of course, there are other document-based, column storage, graph database, xml database, etc. Compared with the current overwhelming use of relational databases, this concept is undoubtedly an injection of new thinking."
